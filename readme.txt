Duplicates the Manage patterns link to the WordPress admin menu. That’s it.

== Description ==
Duplicates the Manage patterns link to the WordPress admin menu. That’s it.

The Manage patterns link can be difficult to find, especially for new or unfamiliar users. This plugin simply duplicates it as a top-level menu item on the WordPress admin menu.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `manage-patterns-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).

You will then see **Manage patterns** in your WordPress admin menu. Typically, it will show just below the Comments menu item.
